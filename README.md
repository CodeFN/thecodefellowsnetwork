# The Code Fellows Network
The perfect network for the code academy

***

## Concept

The Code Fellows Network is a social media platform designed for use by students of [Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/). It is a social media site that is built to be used as a tool for students to assist them in their studies as they progress through Code Fellows bootcamp. The site is designed to be easily extendable and the hope is that future classes will build upon this original project.
